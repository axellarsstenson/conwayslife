## Overview

Version of John Conway's famous (some might say infamous, Conway himself hated the game since it overshadowed his much more important work) Game of Life.

## Rules

Rules are simple:

1. Any living cell with less than 2 living neighbors will die from underpopulation.
2. Any living cell with more than 3 living neighbors will die from overpopulation.
3. Any dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors will be made alive through reproduction.
